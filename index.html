      <h1> My Favourite Hobby Is... <br> <span id="name"> Art </span> </h1> </div>
    <p> My favourite hobby is making art! I love drawing, doodling and painting in my free time. It calms me down and relaxes me. I love seeing how it turns out in the end. I love drawing using POSCA paint markers and making floral designs and patterns. I look for ideas on Pinterest and Google which give me ideas on what I could make next. I am currently working in a sketchbook, which is all my favourite designs in one place. Art is important as it allows you to stretch your imagination and be creative and that is why I love art! </p>
